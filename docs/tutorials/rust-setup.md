Welcome! In this tutorial you will learn how to create a basic development container for the Rust programming language. Along the way you will gain familiarity with setting up container through VS Code and even be able to wrtie and run a basic Rust program. 

## Why is This Important? 

Setting up a developement container for specific coding languages allows for efficient collaboration by enabling all users to work in the same environment (language version, specific extensions needed, etc...) regardless of their machine. Being able to build, understand, and utilize containers is an important aspect for software developers and further broadens your technical skillset.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this tutorial, please ensure you have:

 1. **A GitHub account**: If you don't have one, sign up at [GitHub](https://github.com).
 2. **Git installed**: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com) if you don't already have it.
 3. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Download and install it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com)
 4. **Docker installed**: Needed to run the dev container. [Get Docker here](https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
 5. **Command Line Basics**: Familiarity with the command line will be beneficial in understanding how to set-up the environment.
