Creating the Dev Container","text":"<p>Now that your repository is set up, open up VS Code and open the folder containing your repo. Then, follow these steps to set up the dev container:</p> <ol> <li> <p>In the root directory of your project, create a folder named <code>.devcontainer</code>. This directory will contain the the files that VS Code will read to configure and run the dev container.</p> </li> <li> <p>Install the Dev Containers extension for VS Code</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a file within <code>.devcontainer</code> called <code>devcontainer.json</code>. This file holds the contents to be configured for the container.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fill the contents of the <code>.json</code> file with the following:</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"name\": \"Rust Dev Container\",\n    \"image\": \"mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/rust:latest\",\n    \"customizations\": {\n        \"vscode\": {\n            \"settings\": {},\n            \"extensions\": [\"rust-lang.rust-analyzer\"]\n        }\n    },\n    \"postCreateCommand\": \"rustc --version\"\n}\n</code></pre> <code>name</code> <p>Name of the dev container</p> <code>image</code> <p>The base image for the container. Specifies what language the environment will run for all users. In this case we are using a basic image provided by Microsoft to run the latest version of Rust.</p> <code>customizations</code> <p>In this part of the file you specify useful extensions in VS Code for the container to configure. In this case we are added the Rust Analyzer extension which adds additional features for developers to edit, format, and error check Rust programs. </p> <code>postCreateCommand</code> <p>This runs commands post the creation of the dev container. In our case we run will run a command that shows us the version of Rust being used to confirm the container is working correctly.    </p> </li> </ol> <p>Image vs Container</p> <p>As mentioned above the image provides the details on the programming language the container will configure and install in the environment. The container is simply the running environment after everything in the <code>.json</code> file has been configured. </p> <p>At this point you should be able to open your project repository in the container. To do so, open up Docker Desktop and then go back into VS Code, press <code>Ctrl + Shift + P</code> which opens up the command palette for VS Code and then search and click on <code>Dev Containers: Reopen in Container</code>. </p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rust-setup/#part-3-creating-a-basic-rust-program","title":"Part 3.

Cargo handles tasks such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends on, and building those libraries.

For more infomation, visit the official Cargo documentation. </p> <p>With the command we just ran, you will see a directory with the name <code>hello_comp423</code> and within it the <code>Cargo.toml</code> file and a subdirectory <code>src</code> which contains <code>main.rs</code> which is where the main functionalty of a Rust program is written.</p> <p>--vcs none</p> <p>When using <code>cargo new</code> it will try to create a new Git repository for your project so we add <code>--vcs none</code> to the end of the command to tell the Version Control to not create one since we already have.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rust-setup/#write-the-program","title":"Write the program","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Open up the <code>main.rs</code> and replace its contents with:</p> <pre><code>fn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello COMP423\");\n}\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Complie and run the program:</p> </li> </ol> <p>To compile, go into the <code>hello_comp423</code> directory in the terminal and type <code>cargo build</code> in the terminal.</p> <p>This command is similar to the <code>gcc</code> command you may be familiar with, in that, it complies your code.
